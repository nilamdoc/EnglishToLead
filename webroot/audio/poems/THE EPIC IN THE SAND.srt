1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,911
THE EPIC IN THE SAND

2
00:00:02,912 --> 00:00:06,039
  Before the heavenly lamp

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,842
In the east could light

4
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:11,242
The ten into eight

5
00:00:11,243 --> 00:00:14,215
Became terror of fright

6
00:00:14,216 --> 00:00:16,816
  As if possessed by

7
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:19,484
Ma Kali herself

8
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:21,330
They made

9
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:24,821
The foes’ graves like a delf

10
00:00:24,822 --> 00:00:27,477
  Albeit outnumbered

11
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:30,580
Yet with glory they stood

12
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:32,876
The barrage of

13
00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:37,150
3.5K from sand and wood

14
00:00:37,151 --> 00:00:39,553
  Fistful of them

15
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:41,997
Stood their ground

16
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:44,136
With their every

17
00:00:44,137 --> 00:00:46,934
Blood curdling sound

18
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:49,869
  An enemy was dropped

19
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,709
An enemy was caught

20
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,918
As steadily the invaders

21
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:58,380
On knee they brought

22
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:00,323
  With valor

23
00:01:00,324 --> 00:01:03,347
Few did lay their lives

24
00:01:03,348 --> 00:01:05,823
Before a foe each

25
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:08,420
Was put to knives

26
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:10,512
  Before the day

27
00:01:10,513 --> 00:01:14,248
Traveled dia-deca* length

28
00:01:14,249 --> 00:01:16,789
Nation’s warriors

29
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,466
Arrived in strength

30
00:01:19,467 --> 00:01:22,355
  And together they brought

31
00:01:22,356 --> 00:01:25,093
The foe to its knees

32
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:28,173
As if a butterfly had

33
00:01:28,174 --> 00:01:31,274
Trapped swarms of bees

34
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:34,206
  Their guns kept spewing

35
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:36,479
Only inferno

36
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,532
Telling the foe

37
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,833
Forever to know

38
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,970
  It had woken

39
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:45,507
Its sleeping death

40
00:01:45,508 --> 00:01:48,175
Forever to throttle

41
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:50,449
Its evil breath

42
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,307
  Outnumbered yet the brave slaughtered

43
00:01:54,308 --> 00:01:56,698
Tens and tens

44
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,249
As if the foe was

45
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,572
A pen of hens

46
00:02:01,573 --> 00:02:04,527
  And when the sun showered

47
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:07,396
Its silver on sand

48
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:10,557
With glee foes cadavers

49
00:02:10,558 --> 00:02:12,755
It just tanned!

50
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:15,007
  Thus with blood

51
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:18,138
They wrote epic in sand

52
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,342
For their valor

53
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:23,570
To be played by every band

54
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:25,614
  The anthem

55
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:30,314
They called Shaurya Divas**

56
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:33,102
With pride to be sung

57
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:35,761
With national vivas

58
00:02:35,762 --> 00:02:38,953
  With élan they retrieved

59
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:41,560
 The Sardar Post

60
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,585
To their valor

61
00:02:43,586 --> 00:02:46,594
Nation raises a toast!

62
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:49,486
  Indebted moist eyes

63
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:52,376
With billion salutes

64
00:02:52,377 --> 00:02:58,227
Look up to you Ati Veers***

65
00:02:58,228 --> 00:03:04,507
All residing in the Bootes****!

66
00:03:04,508 --> 00:03:07,703
  Forever realms would sing

67
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:10,513
This CRPF Saga

68
00:03:10,514 --> 00:03:13,205
On their cenotaphs

69
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:15,206
On their Darga!
