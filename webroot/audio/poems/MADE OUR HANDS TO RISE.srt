1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,451
MADE OUR HANDS TO RISE

2
00:00:02,452 --> 00:00:06,226
Leisurely we strolled down from Godrej Baug

3
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:09,773
Taking a short cut from Malabar Hill path

4
00:00:09,774 --> 00:00:13,839
And as we landed at the mouth of Marine Drive

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,659
A wow escaped with surprise

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,652
For the perfect queen’s necklace

7
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:23,036
And joyously we went on to the Gymkhana

8
00:00:23,037 --> 00:00:25,415
Where some had their pegs

9
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:26,967
Some bhel

10
00:00:26,968 --> 00:00:28,633
Some their tea

11
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:30,999
  Which made us realize

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,796
That our legs had become heavy

13
00:00:33,797 --> 00:00:35,243
As lead

14
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,831
From the unaccustomed path

15
00:00:37,832 --> 00:00:39,542
We did tread

16
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:41,735
And a cab was hailed

17
00:00:41,736 --> 00:00:43,932
As our strength paled

18
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:45,484
In front of

19
00:00:45,485 --> 00:00:47,200
Aging zest

20
00:00:47,201 --> 00:00:50,243
And as we zipped the blissful path

21
00:00:50,244 --> 00:00:52,309
And as we passed

22
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,870
The spot

23
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:56,627
Where Kasab had pumped bullets

24
00:00:56,628 --> 00:00:58,911
All over the patriot

25
00:00:58,912 --> 00:01:00,977
Tukaram Ombale 

26
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,765
The dare devil

27
00:01:02,766 --> 00:01:04,517
Whose statue

28
00:01:04,518 --> 00:01:06,969
Made our hands to rise

29
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,603
To salute

30
00:01:08,604 --> 00:01:10,628
Even the silhouette

31
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:12,416
Of his statue

32
00:01:12,417 --> 00:01:14,213
In the darkness

33
00:01:14,214 --> 00:01:17,179
Blinking with innumerable lights!
