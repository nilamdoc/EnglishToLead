1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,401
Ramu and the Mangoes

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:04,769
A rich man lived in a small 

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,376
town in Tamil Nadu.

4
00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:08,660
One day he brought home two 

5
00:00:08,661 --> 00:00:10,619
large and juicy mangoes.

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,798
He gave them to his servent 

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,589
and said, “ Here Ramu, 

8
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,925
take these to the kitchen and 

9
00:00:16,926 --> 00:00:17,626
cut them.

10
00:00:17,627 --> 00:00:20,155
Make two cup of coffee too.

11
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:22,217
A friend of mine will be 

12
00:00:22,218 --> 00:00:23,207
coming soon.

13
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,558
Make the mangoes and coffee 

14
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:26,818
when he comes,”

15
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,963
Ramu took the mangoes to the 

16
00:00:28,964 --> 00:00:31,035
kitchen and cut them with a 

17
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:31,479
knife.

18
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,083
Then, to make sure they were 

19
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:36,777
not sour, he put one piece in 

20
00:00:36,778 --> 00:00:37,676
his mouth.

21
00:00:37,677 --> 00:00:40,523
Ah, how sweet it tasted!

22
00:00:40,524 --> 00:00:43,126
If I eat just one more piece, 

23
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,643
the master will never know,” 

24
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:46,598
he thought.

25
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:49,079
He put one more piece into 

26
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,918
his mouth, one more…

27
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:52,641
In a few minutes, 

28
00:00:52,642 --> 00:00:54,556
the plate was empty!

29
00:00:54,557 --> 00:00:57,381
Ramu felt a little frightened.

30
00:00:57,382 --> 00:00:59,956
The master was sure to beat 

31
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:00,324
him.

32
00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:02,911
Just then he heard his master 

33
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:04,292
calling, “Ramu, 

34
00:01:04,293 --> 00:01:06,535
have you cut the mangoes ?

35
00:01:06,536 --> 00:01:08,814
Keep the coffee ready too.

36
00:01:08,815 --> 00:01:11,052
My friend will be here any 

37
00:01:11,053 --> 00:01:11,716
minute.”

38
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:13,291
Poor Ramu.

39
00:01:13,292 --> 00:01:15,575
What was he to do now ?

40
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,168
He had already eaten up the 

41
00:01:18,169 --> 00:01:18,909
mangoes.

42
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,851
He thought quickly, 

43
00:01:20,852 --> 00:01:22,406
and got an idea.

44
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:25,267
“Oh master,”he replied.

45
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:27,419
“The knife is blunt.

46
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,000
I can’t cut the mangoes with 

47
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:30,357
it.”

48
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:31,850
“You fool!

49
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:33,825
Why didn’t you tell me 

50
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:36,402
earlier ?” the master shouted.

51
00:01:36,403 --> 00:01:38,504
“Bring the knife here.

52
00:01:38,505 --> 00:01:40,774
I’ll sharpen it for you.”

53
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:42,850
Ramu took a large and blunt 

54
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:44,853
knife from the kitchen and 

55
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,485
gave it to his master.

56
00:01:46,486 --> 00:01:48,654
While the master was busy 

57
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:49,906
sharpening it, 

58
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:52,327
Ramu quietly went out of the 

59
00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:52,828
house.

60
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:55,051
He saw his master’s friend 

61
00:01:55,052 --> 00:01:56,616
coming up the road.

62
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,941
Ramu ran to meet him,.

63
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:01,389
“Sir, sir,” he said to the 

64
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,110
friend, “have you had a fight 

65
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:05,561
with my master ?

66
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:08,026
He says that he will cut off 

67
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,472
both your ears !”

68
00:02:09,473 --> 00:02:12,274
The friend stared in surprise.

69
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:14,649
“Fight ?” he said.

70
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,963
“We didn’t really have a 

71
00:02:16,964 --> 00:02:17,519
fight.

72
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,037
But yesterday when he came to 

73
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:21,968
my house, I put on his 

74
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,648
chappals by mistake.

75
00:02:23,649 --> 00:02:25,908
Now why should he want to cut 

76
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:27,792
off my ears for a little 

77
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:29,073
thing like that?”

78
00:02:29,074 --> 00:02:31,282
“I’m telling you, Sir, 

79
00:02:31,283 --> 00:02:33,685
he wants to cut off your 

80
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,895
ears.” Ramu said again.

81
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:37,887
“If you don’t believe  me. 

82
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:39,806
you can see for  yourself.

83
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:42,757
But mind, don’t let him catch 

84
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:43,249
you!”

85
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,127
The friend crept up to an 

86
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:46,861
open window and saw the 

87
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:48,307
master of the house 

88
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:49,969
sharpening a big knife.

89
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,766
“My goodness!” he cried.

90
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:55,348
“He really wants to cut off 

91
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:56,086
my ears!

92
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:58,449
I had better run away before 

93
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,813
he sees me.” He turned round 

94
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:03,095
and ran back the way he had 

95
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:03,503
come.

96
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:06,096
Ramu then ran to his master 

97
00:03:06,097 --> 00:03:08,411
crying, “Master, master, 

98
00:03:08,412 --> 00:03:10,911
your friend has taken both 

99
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:12,023
the mangoes.

100
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:14,866
There he is, running away!”

101
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:17,117
The master looked up and saw 

102
00:03:17,118 --> 00:03:19,214
his friend running away at 

103
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:19,991
top speed.

104
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,427
He rushed out and ran after 

105
00:03:22,428 --> 00:03:23,384
his friend.

106
00:03:23,385 --> 00:03:24,750
“Stop!

107
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:27,411
Stop!” he shouted.

108
00:03:27,412 --> 00:03:29,228
“Keep one of them if you 

109
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:31,118
like, but let me have the 

110
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:33,298
other one!” The friend looked 

111
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:35,043
back and saw the master 

112
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:37,151
running after him with a big 

113
00:03:37,152 --> 00:03:38,460
knife in one hand.

114
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:40,685
He screamed in terror.

115
00:03:40,686 --> 00:03:42,409
Doubling his speed, 

116
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,823
he vanished in the distance.

117
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,087
The master soon gave up the 

118
00:03:47,088 --> 00:03:49,271
chase and went back to his 

119
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:49,757
house.

120
00:03:49,758 --> 00:03:51,871
Calling Ramu, he said, 

121
00:03:51,872 --> 00:03:54,628
“I never knew how greedy this 

122
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:56,927
man was, and a thief too!

123
00:03:56,928 --> 00:03:59,338
Thank you for telling me.” He 

124
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,508
then went out and came out 

125
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,919
with two more large and juicy 

126
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,563
mangoes.

127
00:04:04,564 --> 00:04:07,627
Giving them to Ramu, he said, 

128
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:10,079
“Here Ramu, you eat one.

129
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,672
And cut the other one for me.”
