1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,692
Two and Three

2
00:00:01,693 --> 00:00:03,447
In a small village in 

3
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:05,840
Himachal (A state in northern 

4
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:08,234
hilly region in India.) lived 

5
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:10,149
an old man and his wife.

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,422
Both were over seventy and 

7
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:14,360
both loved one another.

8
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:16,467
Only five other families 

9
00:00:16,468 --> 00:00:18,744
lived in this tiny village.

10
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:20,911
One cold winter evening the 

11
00:00:20,912 --> 00:00:22,924
old man and his wife were 

12
00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:24,860
sitting inside their hut.

13
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:27,371
Outside it was snowing.

14
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:29,549
Suddenly the old man looked 

15
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,883
up and said, “I wish we could 

16
00:00:31,884 --> 00:00:33,829
have some pakodas (Salty 

17
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,852
snacks prepared by frying 

18
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:38,186
vegetable mixed in gram flour 

19
00:00:38,187 --> 00:00:38,809
batter).

20
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,380
I very much feel like eating 

21
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:42,711
pakodas today.”

22
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:44,969
“I’ll see if there’s any 

23
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:47,318
besan (Gram flour) in the 

24
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:49,577
house,” his wife replied.

25
00:00:49,578 --> 00:00:52,379
She got up and opened the tin 

26
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,220
of besan.

27
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:55,712
“Oh, there’s only a little 

28
00:00:55,713 --> 00:00:57,558
bit here,” she said.

29
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,112
“It’s too cold to go out and 

30
00:01:00,113 --> 00:01:00,905
buy more.

31
00:01:00,906 --> 00:01:03,314
So I shall make pakodas from 

32
00:01:03,315 --> 00:01:05,475
this little bit of besan.”

33
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:07,785
The old woman lighted the 

34
00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:09,741
fire and made pakodas.

35
00:01:09,742 --> 00:01:11,702
She made five.

36
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:13,933
She gave her husband three 

37
00:01:13,934 --> 00:01:16,331
pakodas and herself took two.

38
00:01:16,332 --> 00:01:18,591
But the old man would not 

39
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,156
take the palcodas.

40
00:01:20,157 --> 00:01:22,665
How can I eat three when you 

41
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,002
are getting only two ?” he 

42
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:25,435
said.

43
00:01:25,436 --> 00:01:27,951
“Take one pakoda from me.”

44
00:01:27,952 --> 00:01:30,451
“Two pakodas are enough for 

45
00:01:30,452 --> 00:01:32,417
me,” his wife replied.

46
00:01:32,418 --> 00:01:35,033
“It is you who asked for them.

47
00:01:35,034 --> 00:01:37,067
You take three now.

48
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:39,219
Tomorrow I shall get more 

49
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,620
besan from the shop and make 

50
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:42,283
pakodas.

51
00:01:42,284 --> 00:01:44,750
I can then take one more than 

52
00:01:44,751 --> 00:01:45,162
you.”

53
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:47,968
“We’ll see about that later,” 

54
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:49,559
the old man said.

55
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,203
“But today you must eat three 

56
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:52,997
pakodas.”

57
00:01:52,998 --> 00:01:55,407
They kept arguing like this 

58
00:01:55,408 --> 00:01:56,440
all evening.

59
00:01:56,441 --> 00:01:58,625
Night fell, but they had 

60
00:01:58,626 --> 00:02:01,074
still not eaten the pakodas.

61
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:04,090
At last they agreed on a plan.

62
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:07,256
“It is quite late,” they said.

63
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:10,176
“So let us go to sleep now.

64
00:02:10,177 --> 00:02:11,616
Tomorrow morning, 

65
00:02:11,617 --> 00:02:13,698
the one who gets up first 

66
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,539
will have to eat three 

67
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,260
pakodas.”

68
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,021
So they both went to sleep.

69
00:02:19,022 --> 00:02:20,723
Morning came.

70
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:23,317
But still they kept lying in 

71
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:24,839
bed, eyes closed.

72
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,115
Each wanted the other to get 

73
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:29,470
up first, for each wanted the 

74
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:31,354
other one to have three 

75
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:31,982
pakodas.

76
00:02:31,983 --> 00:02:34,203
It grew quite late and the 

77
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:36,261
sun rose high in the sky.

78
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:38,837
But still they would not get 

79
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:39,104
up.

80
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:41,386
The neighbours saw that their 

81
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:43,061
door was still closed.

82
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,995
They got worried.

83
00:02:44,996 --> 00:02:47,279
“What is the matter with the 

84
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,170
old couple ?” they said.

85
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:51,858
“They still have not got up.

86
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:54,140
Let us go and find out if 

87
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:55,896
they are all right.”

88
00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:57,706
The neighbours went and 

89
00:02:57,707 --> 00:02:59,216
knocked at the door.

90
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:01,432
They called out to the old 

91
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:03,485
couple, but there was no 

92
00:03:03,486 --> 00:03:04,963
reply from inside.

93
00:03:04,964 --> 00:03:06,996
Then the neighbours hammered 

94
00:03:06,997 --> 00:03:09,029
at the door with their fists.

95
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,430
But still the door remained 

96
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:12,031
closed.

97
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:14,765
Now they got really worried.

98
00:03:14,766 --> 00:03:17,136
“We shall have to break the 

99
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:18,576
door,” they said.

100
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:21,055
“The old people may be ill.”

101
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:23,304
So they brought an axe and 

102
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:24,971
broke open the door.

103
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,223
They then went in and saw the 

104
00:03:27,224 --> 00:03:29,475
old man and his wife lying on 

105
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,578
their cots with eyes closed.

106
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,907
“Oh no,” they said.

107
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:35,968
“They are both dead!

108
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:37,921
Let us take them to the 

109
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:39,143
burning place.”

110
00:03:39,144 --> 00:03:41,628
When the old man heard this 

111
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:43,404
he shot up in alarm.

112
00:03:43,405 --> 00:03:45,695
He realised that they would 

113
00:03:45,696 --> 00:03:47,333
both be burnt alive.

114
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:50,130
“Oh very well,” he cried.

115
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:52,358
“I shall eat three andyou can 

116
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:54,066
eat the other two.” On 

117
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,071
hearing this the old woman 

118
00:03:56,072 --> 00:03:57,853
also shot up and cried, 

119
00:03:57,854 --> 00:03:59,562
“That’s what I’ve been 

120
00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:01,493
telling you all this time.

121
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:03,662
If you had listened to me, 

122
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:06,072
we could have eaten them last 

123
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:06,554
night.

124
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:08,883
We wouldn’t have gone hungry 

125
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:10,088
all night then.

126
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:12,467
But we can eat them now.”

127
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:14,359
When the neighbours heard 

128
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,033
this they were alarmed.

129
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:18,250
They ran out of the door 

130
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:19,049
shouting.

131
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,224
“Run!

132
00:04:20,225 --> 00:04:22,326
Run for your life!

133
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:25,028
The ghosts of the old man and 

134
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:27,010
his wife are after us!

135
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:29,701
They are going to eat us all 

136
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:29,980
up!

137
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:32,120
The old man’s ghost will eat 

138
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:33,522
up three families, 

139
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,735
and his wife’s ghost will eat 

140
00:04:35,736 --> 00:04:37,875
up the other two families in 

141
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:38,909
the village !”

142
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,719
The old man and his wife were 

143
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,656
surprised.

144
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,815
They ran after the neighbours 

145
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:46,830
to tell them that they were 

146
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:47,622
not ghosts.

147
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:49,714
At this the neighbours were 

148
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:51,283
even more frightened.

149
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:53,644
They ran faster still.

150
00:04:53,645 --> 00:04:55,817
Much later the old man and 

151
00:04:55,818 --> 00:04:58,152
his wife told the neighbours 

152
00:04:58,153 --> 00:04:59,601
about the pakodas.

153
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:01,532
When they heard this, 

154
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,639
they burst out laughing.

155
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,429
That day the old woman 

156
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,610
brought more besan from the 

157
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:09,946
shop and made lots of pakodas.

158
00:05:09,947 --> 00:05:12,239
Then she invited everyone in 

159
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,374
the village for a feast of 

160
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,007
pakodas.

161
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:17,350
You see, she was sorry that 

162
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,861
she and her old man had given 

163
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,786
everyone such a fright.

164
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:23,920
Third Story for You

165
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:25,831
Hospital Window

166
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:28,589
Two men, both seriously ill, 

167
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,157
occupied the same hospital 

168
00:05:31,158 --> 00:05:31,633
room.

169
00:05:31,634 --> 00:05:33,907
One man was allowed to sit up 

170
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:36,029
in his bed for an hour each 

171
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,152
afternoon to help drain the 

172
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:39,744
fluid from his lungs.

173
00:05:39,745 --> 00:05:41,787
His bed was next to the 

174
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:43,405
room’s only window.

175
00:05:43,406 --> 00:05:45,662
The other man had to spend 

176
00:05:45,663 --> 00:05:48,171
all his time flat on his back.

177
00:05:48,172 --> 00:05:50,670
The men talked for hours on 

178
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:51,028
end.

179
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:53,408
They spoke of their wives and 

180
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:55,234
families, their homes, 

181
00:05:55,235 --> 00:05:57,615
their jobs, their involvement 

182
00:05:57,616 --> 00:05:59,599
in the military service, 

183
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,424
where they had been on 

184
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:02,139
vacation.

185
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,485
  Every afternoon, 

186
00:06:03,486 --> 00:06:05,470
 when the man in the bed by 

187
00:06:05,471 --> 00:06:07,243
the window could sit up, 

188
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:09,086
he would pass the time by 

189
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:11,000
describing to his roommate 

190
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:12,985
all the things he could see 

191
00:06:12,986 --> 00:06:14,332
outside the window.

192
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,051
The man in the other bed 

193
00:06:16,052 --> 00:06:17,978
began to live for those one 

194
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:19,973
hour periods where his world 

195
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:21,555
would be broadened and 

196
00:06:21,556 --> 00:06:23,619
enlivened by all the activity 

197
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,201
and color of the world 

198
00:06:25,202 --> 00:06:25,752
outside.

199
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:28,098
The window overlooked a park 

200
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:29,636
with a lovely lake.

201
00:06:29,637 --> 00:06:31,883
Ducks and swans played on the 

202
00:06:31,884 --> 00:06:33,980
water while children sailed 

203
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:35,329
their model boats.

204
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,365
Young lovers walked arm in 

205
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:39,477
arm amidst flowers of every 

206
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:41,664
color and a fine view of the 

207
00:06:41,665 --> 00:06:43,927
city skyline could be seen in 

208
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:44,908
the distance.

209
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,722
As the man by the window 

210
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:48,318
described all this in 

211
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,697
exquisite details, 

212
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:51,802
the man on the other side of 

213
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:53,979
the room would close his eyes 

214
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,083
and imagine this picturesque 

215
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:56,519
scene.

216
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,245
One warm afternoon, 

217
00:06:58,246 --> 00:07:00,145
the man by the window 

218
00:07:00,146 --> 00:07:02,735
described a parade passing by.

219
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:04,790
Although the other man could 

220
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,137
not hear the band, 

221
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:08,263
he could see it in his mind’s 

222
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:10,248
eye as the gentleman by the 

223
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:12,020
window portrayed it with 

224
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:13,296
descriptive words.

225
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:16,593
Days, weeks and months passed.

226
00:07:16,594 --> 00:07:18,593
One morning, the day nurse 

227
00:07:18,594 --> 00:07:20,593
arrived to bring water for 

228
00:07:20,594 --> 00:07:22,741
their baths only to find the 

229
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,815
lifeless body of the man by 

230
00:07:24,816 --> 00:07:26,667
the window, who had died 

231
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:28,445
peacefully in his sleep.

232
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:30,602
She was saddened and called 

233
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:32,682
the hospital attendants to 

234
00:07:32,683 --> 00:07:34,147
take the body away.

235
00:07:34,148 --> 00:07:35,791
As soon as it seemed 

236
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:37,905
appropriate, the other man 

237
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:40,020
asked if he could be moved 

238
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:41,508
next to the window.

239
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:43,804
The nurse was happy to make 

240
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:46,183
the switch, and after making 

241
00:07:46,184 --> 00:07:48,233
sure he was comfortable, 

242
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,792
she left him alone.

243
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:51,419
Slowly, painfully, 

244
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,904
he propped himself up on one 

245
00:07:53,905 --> 00:07:56,389
elbow to take his first look 

246
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,617
at the real world outside.

247
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:00,923
He strained to slowly turn to 

248
00:08:00,924 --> 00:08:02,998
look out the window beside 

249
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:03,614
the bed.

250
00:08:03,615 --> 00:08:05,966
It faced a blank wall.

251
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:07,970
The man asked the nurse what 

252
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:09,698
could have compelled his 

253
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,496
deceased roommate who had 

254
00:08:11,497 --> 00:08:13,224
described such wonderful 

255
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,091
things outside this window.

256
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:17,364
The nurse responded that the 

257
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:19,559
man was blind and could not 

258
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,970
even see the wall.

259
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:23,394
She said, ‘Perhaps he just 

260
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:25,640
wanted to encourage you.’

261
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,051
Epilogue:

262
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:29,467
There is tremendous happiness 

263
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,401
in making others happy, 

264
00:08:31,402 --> 00:08:33,576
despite our own situations.

265
00:08:33,577 --> 00:08:35,634
Shared grief is half the 

266
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:37,858
sorrow, but happiness when 

267
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:39,423
shared, is doubled.

268
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:41,450
If you want to feel rich, 

269
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:43,788
just count all the things you 

270
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,816
have that money can’t buy.

271
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:47,204
‘Today is a gift, 

272
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:49,287
that is why it is called   

273
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:50,291
The Present.’
