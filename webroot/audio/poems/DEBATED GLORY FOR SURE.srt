1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,804
DEBATED GLORY FOR SURE

2
00:00:02,805 --> 00:00:05,694
Where to, from here?

3
00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:07,970
In the world we could know 

4
00:00:07,971 --> 00:00:10,331
self, only after peeping in 

5
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:12,523
the mirror, always with a 

6
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:13,872
lurking terror, 

7
00:00:13,873 --> 00:00:16,401
where a mythology begins with 

8
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:18,761
the question like who am I; 

9
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:19,942
where are we; 

10
00:00:19,943 --> 00:00:22,387
perpetually questioning what 

11
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:23,567
we are doing, 

12
00:00:23,568 --> 00:00:25,085
why are we doing, 

13
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:27,361
and looking up to the sky, 

14
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:28,541
a futile try, 

15
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:30,818
to know from the so called 

16
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:32,757
Lord, in the sky, why, 

17
00:00:32,758 --> 00:00:33,769
why me, why?

18
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,209
I have yet to find an answer, 

19
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,405
to such lurking questions, 

20
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:39,626
and many more, 

21
00:00:39,627 --> 00:00:42,066
with tension that keep all of 

22
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:44,263
us on toes, many a time at 

23
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:46,215
brink of unknown throe, 

24
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:47,923
at sleepless nights, 

25
00:00:47,924 --> 00:00:49,550
with all our might, 

26
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:51,747
like Romare Bearden asking 

27
00:00:51,748 --> 00:00:54,187
Odysseus, if he could answers 

28
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:56,465
to our tormenting questions 

29
00:00:56,466 --> 00:00:58,824
from his near fatal voyages, 

30
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,533
or begging Dharmaraj 

31
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:02,729
Yudhisther if Yaksha asked 

32
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,356
him such questions, 

33
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:06,065
as we ask ourselves, 

34
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,773
and could he answer, 

35
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:09,481
not only to save his 

36
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:11,515
brothers, but the entire 

37
00:01:11,516 --> 00:01:12,329
humankind!

38
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,279
The journey always rough, 

39
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,229
some miserable god tough, 

40
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,254
in the belly of the earth, 

41
00:01:18,255 --> 00:01:20,429
and in the bosom of the sea, 

42
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,854
always looking for 

43
00:01:21,855 --> 00:01:23,879
retribution, people always 

44
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,755
succumbing to pollution; 

45
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:28,005
the hero is the one who comes 

46
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:30,255
home, even if it’s by process 

47
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,530
of elimination - 

48
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:33,330
a playwright can make a 

49
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:35,280
mythology asking - what’s 

50
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:37,231
wrong with this song as a 

51
00:01:37,232 --> 00:01:39,331
solution? It is like Arjuna 

52
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:41,431
asking Krishna about coming 

53
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:43,381
home from the war, so why 

54
00:01:43,382 --> 00:01:45,406
are you a hero and why are 

55
00:01:45,407 --> 00:01:47,581
you still coming home from a 

56
00:01:47,582 --> 00:01:49,532
war and not only men even 

57
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:51,707
women raped and die in wars, 

58
00:01:51,708 --> 00:01:53,582
in the name of ablution, 

59
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:55,832
even if it’s not the expected 

60
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,007
dishonor and death then what 

61
00:01:58,008 --> 00:01:59,657
attribution and ----- 

62
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:01,758
wait that’s not a question, 

63
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,858
but it’s still a mythology, 

64
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:06,033
if that’s the only anthology 

65
00:02:06,034 --> 00:02:07,983
we are told to live with, 

66
00:02:07,984 --> 00:02:10,158
for sure a failing posology, 

67
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,108
for our debated glory for 

68
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:12,484
sure.
