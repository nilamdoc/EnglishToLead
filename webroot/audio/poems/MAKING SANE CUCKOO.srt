MAKING SANE CUCKOO

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,735
Was it a coincident that the 

3
00:00:04,736 --> 00:00:06,838
first post I opened in my 

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,266
mobile, it threatened to tell 

5
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:11,046
me, about the 25 most 

6
00:00:11,047 --> 00:00:13,230
dangerous places on earth, 

7
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:15,010
the list surprisingly 

8
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:16,709
included Mumbai too, 

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,651
albeit it is one of the 

10
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:20,593
safest cities in India, 

11
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:22,858
in comparison to many more, 

12
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,881
as dangerous as those in 

13
00:00:24,882 --> 00:00:27,308
Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, 

14
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:29,169
Congo etc, or was it a 

15
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,596
conspiracy that the very next 

16
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:33,700
post was from Lallanatop, 

17
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,046
talking about Ek Kavita Roz, 

18
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:37,179
a poem a day, 

19
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,525
the one in question was sans 

20
00:00:39,526 --> 00:00:41,710
any title, by Darpan Shah, 

21
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:44,137
that also glorified crime and 

22
00:00:44,138 --> 00:00:46,402
assured that all the crimes 

23
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:48,668
would be rewarded in haven, 

24
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:50,043
and the priests, 

25
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:51,985
and the pundits and the 

26
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:54,089
mullahs and sheikhs would 

27
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,869
burn in the hell fire?

28
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,717
I could not decipher, 

29
00:00:57,718 --> 00:01:00,237
if that was true or a satire, 

30
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:02,505
or a figment of the mind a 

31
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:04,017
frustrated shyre, 

32
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:06,033
a poet penning in Urdu, 

33
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:08,385
not knowing whether to boo, 

34
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:10,485
or to eschew the desire, 

35
00:01:10,486 --> 00:01:11,745
sans any clue, 

36
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:14,097
what the hell is the poetic 

37
00:01:14,098 --> 00:01:16,449
brew, painting trepidation, 

38
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,717
drowned in murky political 

39
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:20,901
stew, not only spreading, 

40
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:22,917
but prevailing like the 

41
00:01:22,918 --> 00:01:24,765
threat of ubiquitous, 

42
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:26,193
CORONAVIRUS flu, 

43
00:01:26,194 --> 00:01:27,789
making sane cuckoo!
